## Introduction
This repository contains solutions to programming exercises from [Assembly Language for x86 Processors (8th Edition) by Kip Irvine](http://www.asmirvine.com/). I've documented each solution to the best of my ability. If you encounter any issues or have feedback, please don't hesitate to let me know.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Kip Irvine, the author of the book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and learned a great deal. I highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to learn assembly language programming.
